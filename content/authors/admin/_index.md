Hello! My name is Ruilin (Sam) Jin, I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science in the [Department of Computer & Data Sciences](https://engineering.case.edu/computer-and-data-sciences) at [Case Western Reserve University (CWRU)](https://case.edu/), focusing on Artificial Intelligence. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science in [Information Technology and Web Science](https://science.rpi.edu/itws) at the [School of Science](https://science.rpi.edu/), [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/) in 2021. Following my undergraduate studies, I gained two years of industry experience as a full-stack developer at CREC Cloud Net Information Technology Co., Ltd.

My academic and research endeavors focus on machine learning, data mining, computer vision, and generative models. I am particularly fascinated by the applications of these fields in image and video editing and synthesis.

I'm a contributor to [Hello Algo](https://www.hello-algo.com/), a data structures and algorithms crash course with animated illustrations and codes. Check it out!

<span style="font-weight:600">
I am actively seeking employment opportunities in the fields of Full Stack Development, Frontend Development, and Machine Learning Engineering.
